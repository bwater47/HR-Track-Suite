# HR-Track-Suite
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)
- 
This application is for tracking employee data, and has a walkthrough video on how it works!

## Description

- My motivation for building this application was to create an employee data tracking application for HR called HR-Track-Suite that allows the client to track employee data on their device.
- This project was built to provide the client with an application to track employee data using their computer and or phone.
- This solves the problem of not being able to keep relevant employee data stored inside of a database for the company of the client.
- In this project, I learned that PostgreSQL is a secure and protective language that enables me to concentrate on backend development seamlessly, without affecting the vulnerability of client data.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, NPM inquirer, NPM pg, Express, and PostgreSQL. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally in your device you can open VSCode. Lastly once VSCode is running open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules package, then type npm run start. Once you've done this the website will be deployed locally for testing, debugging, and developing.

## Usage

The HR Track Suite is convienient for anyone needing something to help securely store employee data. Update your employee data so that it stays up to date easily from within the CLI.
